## Tumblr Template Engine

This python library parses and renders tumblr templates. All it takes is the template string and the Tumblr's JSON API output.

The context mapper is designed to make feeding of data into the engine easy, so all you have to do is grab tumblr's data in json format.

*Note:* 
 - There may be bugs, please create an issue if it needs addressing.
 - Only partial tumblr spec has been implemented.
